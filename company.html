      Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, and officially became Nike, Inc. on May 30,
      1971. The company takes its name from Nike, the Greek goddess of
      victory.[8] Nike markets its products under its own brand, as well as Nike
      Golf, Nike Pro, Nike+, Nike Blazers, Air Force 1, Nike Dunk, Air Max,
